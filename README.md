# StereoscopicVision

The project focuses on the implementation of OpenMP pragma directives to allow an OpenCV application execute tasks more efficiently on a multithreaded CPU. The parallelization is set to allow the following functionality:

> 1. Two camera feeds
> 2. Data Collection and Remote Export
> 3. Data Import form Remote and further Export to the periphery
